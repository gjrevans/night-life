### Starter Application for Node JS
To get started clone the project to a local folder and make any desired changes.

### Getting Started
1. Run `npm install` to install the required node modules locally
2. Copy .sample_env and provide local values
3. To run a local server run `gulp` from your terminal.

### Notes
To run a production server run `npm start` from your terminal.

If deploying to Heroku, tell Heroku to run `npm start` & create a post install script that runs `grunt dist`.
